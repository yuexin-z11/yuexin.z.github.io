                    <p>I'm particularly passionate about <strong>learning new things</strong>. I find joy in exploring new topics, acquiring new skills, and constantly expanding my knowledge. This curiosity drives me to take on new challenges and grow both personally and professionally.</p>
                    <p>Sports play a big role in my life as well. I've been an avid <strong>tennis player</strong> all through high school, enjoying the physical and mental challenges that the sport offers. Similarly, <strong>figure skating</strong> has been a graceful outlet for my creativity and love for movement.</p>
                    <p>Spending time with <strong>friends and family</strong> is incredibly important to me. I cherish the connections I have with the people in my life, and I believe that strong relationships are the foundation of happiness.</p>
                    <p>I'm also a proud Aggie, deeply immersed in <strong>Texas A&M traditions</strong>. Serving as a Fish Camp Counselor for 2 years has allowed me to connect with new students and help them transition into college life. It's been a rewarding experience that I've cherished greatly.</p>
