        <h1>Hi, everyone</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my page. I am Yuexin, a junior computer engineering major from China. I am currently studying at Texas A&M University. I chose this major because I wanted to do something that is related to software but also hardware. This past summer, I focused on the software side and interned at Supcon Technology, assisting them with training industrialized models to answer industry-specific questions and developing my interest in artificial intelligence. I would love to explore more areas within the field, and I am passionate about a lot of the things I do. You can learn more about the projects I have done on the qualifications page.</p>
        <p>I am very involved on campus, and I was a counselor for multiple organizations. I enjoyed helping people, especially freshmen transitioning into college, and I have enjoyed getting to know every single one of them. I love talking to people and getting to know them. Those organizations I was able to join provided me with so many friends and memories that will last a lifetime. I was also able to participate in many service projects to give back to this Bryan College Station community. You can learn more about what I have done and did on the service and projects page.</p>
        <p>I love meeting new people during my time away from work. I think I was always able to learn so much from each person and the same time positively impact them. In a new environment, I would always reach out to people first and try to remember their names. I am a team player and I know projects can be done more effectively if everyone is in a position they are best at. I was able to fit in and befriend people in a short time and it is one of my strong suits.</p>
        <p>I love meeting new people and wanted to get to know you. If you want to learn more about me and talk to me about more job opportunities, please go to the Contact Me page. My social media website will be here, or you can reach out to me through the contact information at the end of each web page.</p>
        <p>Thank you and I hope you enjoyed viewing this website!</p>
